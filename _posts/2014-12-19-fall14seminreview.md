The semester is finally over! I had entirely forgotten about the feeling of freedom I felt today walking home tonight after my last final. Here are some notes to myself about how this semester went.

Okay, so what I learned this semester:

- Math H54 - Linear Algebra and Differential Equations

- CS 61C - Computer Architecture

- EE 40 - Circuits

- EE 120 - Signal Processing and Control

- Philosophy 12 - Logic

Some thoughts about the schedule: good load and it had surprising synergy. The end of 40 was very basic with everything we did in 120, 54 and 120 overlapped over diff eq's, and 40 and 61C met at the transistor level, even 61C and philosophical logic had some overlap. None of the classes directly helped any other but in general I walked away feeling that it was actually quite a coherent semester and I had made quite a few connections between subjects I would not have gotten from taking either class alone. In retrospect, I would not have taken philosophy and not too sure about 120 either, as the first half was a repetition of Fourier analysis.

Other highlights of the semester: CalHacks (biggest hackathon ever to date!), going to Las Vegas for the Money 20/20 hackathon, going to Los Angeles for a friend's birthday. I spent a lot of time web hacking - actually looking to avoid that altogether in the future, it's just not that stimulating. Also took a Coursera class on machine learning which was a nice overview but not rigorous enough, and got reasonably familiar with the Scrapy library as well as different web-dev libraries.

Time to get serious! Planning to get better at programming problems and to learn about computer vision and get familiar with OpenCV over the break.
