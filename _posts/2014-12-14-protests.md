Recently at Berkeley we've had a series of protests: first a minor protest on tuition hikes and then very large-scale social unrest surrounding race and police brutality. Judging the social good the protests do is difficult. This week at Berkeley, peaceful protesting has been overshadowed by uneccessary looting and destruction. However, many people speak out that protesting is totally futile and useless but this is simply wrong: civil disobedience is often the only way to bring attention to things that are not being addressed! The problem isn't just apathy, its that many people have an attitude towards the concept of a protest, and this gets in the way of talking about the issues behind them.
