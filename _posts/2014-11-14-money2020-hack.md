This is a small little web app hack made at Money 20-20 in Las Vegas over Halloween weekend 2014. Built in about 12 hours, it runs on Rails with an AngularJS frontend.

It integrates the Venmo API to flexibly split expenses through one person - the point of convenience being that only one person need sign in to Venmo, not everyone who wants to split.

This funny code snippet is Roy's hack in the final seconds before the project was due:

{% highlight ruby %}
    resp = `curl -X POST -d "access_token=#{access_token}&email=#{email}&note=#{note}&amount=#{amount}&audience=#{audience}" "https://api.venmo.com/v1/payments"`
        puts(resp)
{% endhighlight %}

It calls the Venmo API through curl because we were bashing our heads against the Ruby HTTP request library for a long time and it simply wouldn't work.
