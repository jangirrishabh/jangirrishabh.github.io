I am **Rishabh Jangir**, a final year undergraduate B.Tech student at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati majoring in Physics. Driven by my self-cultivated interest in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence I decided to dedicate myself towards research in these fields for the remainder of my life.

As of Summer 2016 I am a research intern at the Robotics Research Lab, IIIT Hyderabad under Dr.K. Madhava Krishna, working on **Reinforcement Learning** and its application in visual navigation and SLAM. Previously in summer 2015 I worked on point cloud segregation of identified objects using PTAM(monocular SLAM) at the same lab. 

My recent work has strengthened my belief towards artificial intelligence and its application in the field of robotics, I believe that some of the very challenging problems in robotics can be tackled through machine intelligence. My current research interests revolve around deep reinforcement learning, multi robot co-ordination and human-robot interaction.

Over the course of my undergraduate studies I squeezed in three internships, two internships in computer Vision and robotics at the above mentioned lab and one internship in ioT and embedded systems at a startup, SimpleLabs, where I worked on wireless data transfer protocols and networks in bluetooth Low Energy a.k.a. bluetooth 4.0.

One of the best experiences in my undergraduate college life has been my involvement with the Robotics Club, IIT Guwahati. I headed the chair as the Secretary, Robotics Club 2015-16, leading a team of over 40 undergraduate students to work on a multitude of projects throughout the year, sharing ideas, discussing difficulties, implementing them and at the end of the year showcasing them to the college community.

On a side for fun I blog, tweet, and build robots.
